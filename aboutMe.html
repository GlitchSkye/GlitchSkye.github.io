        <p> Hello I am a student studying software engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. </p>

        <p> During university I created a web app to assist a charity by the name of The Saviour Trust. This was done
            after being given
            specifications from the company. the website was meant to assist them with data handling. we did this by
            setting up new
            databases and using C# ASP.NET for the funstionality. I did this in a group of four and was mainly working
            on the backend but also
            helped on the front end where needed. I achieved a first in this module. </p>

        <p> Outside of university I try to improve my programming skills. I have been practicing javascript and working
            with
            APIs by creating discord bots, for example
            <a id="repoLink" href="https://github.com/skyerin8/just-another-discord-bot">this</a> one.
            This project also helped me learn how to work with different frameworks (in this case Discord.js).
